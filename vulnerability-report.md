## ðŸ“Œ Vulnerability Name: PHP `expose_php` Information Disclosure

---

## 5. ðŸ“‹ Vulnerability Review

### âœ… Description:
The `expose_php` directive in the `php.ini` file is enabled by default. This causes the PHP version number to be exposed in the `X-Powered-By` HTTP response header. An attacker can use this information to identify the PHP version in use and potentially exploit known vulnerabilities in that version.

### ðŸ§  Why It Matters:
Information disclosure does not directly compromise the system but increases the attack surface. When attackers know the exact version of PHP running on a server, they can use targeted exploits if that version has known vulnerabilities.

### ðŸ›‘ Example Header:
```http
X-Powered-By: PHP/8.1.2
