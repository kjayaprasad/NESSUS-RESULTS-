During this assessment, I selected the OWASP Broken Web Applications (OWASP BWA) target machine, provided by Rapid7, which I commonly use for practicing bug bounty and penetration testing techniques. The engagement focused primarily on services such as web servers, where I identified and documented several vulnerabilities for further analysis and remediation practice.

# OWASP BWA Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Overview
This repository contains the results of a targeted vulnerability assessment conducted against the **OWASP Broken Web Applications (OWASP BWA)** virtual machine provided by Rapid7.  
The purpose of this engagement was purely educational, focusing on developing vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and bug bounty skills in a controlled lab environment.

## Scope
- **Target**: OWASP BWA (local lab instance)
- **Primary Focus**: Web server services and associated applications
- **Assessment Tool**: Nessus Essentials
- **Scan Type**: Full vulnerability scan with emphasis on web application and service enumeration

---

## Methodology
1. **Target Identification**  
   Configured the OWASP BWA machine as the scan target within Nessus Essentials.
2. **Vulnerability Scan**  
   Executed a comprehensive scan with emphasis on web services and known exploitable vulnerabilities.
3. **Result Analysis**  
   Reviewed the scan output to identify critical, high, and medium-severity findings.
4. **Documentation**  
   Exported and sanitized the report to remove sensitive environment-specific details.

## Key Findings
- Multiple outdated web application frameworks with known vulnerabilities.
- Misconfigured web server components allowing potential information disclosure.
- Insecure HTTP methods enabled on certain endpoints.
- Application-specific vulnerabilities such as outdated CMS installations.

> **Note:** All vulnerabilities identified exist by design within the OWASP BWA environment and are intended for training purposes.
